# Mankirat Singh Cheema 👋

Researcher and builder focused on AI alignment, value learning, and safe autonomous systems.

## 🧠 About Me

I explore how artificial agents can reason about values, preserve identity under reflection, and evolve safely under human governance. My work combines:

- AI alignment and safety
- Value representation and pluralism
- Meta-cognition and self-monitoring systems
- Adversarial testing and governance mechanisms
- Formal models of identity and constraint satisfaction

## 🚀 Featured Project

### Dao Heart 3.0
A research framework for **identity-preserving value evolution in AI systems**.

Key ideas:
- Constraint-Satisfaction Value Networks (CSVN)
- Constitutive Reflection Engine (CRE)
- Meta-Cognitive Stability Observer (MCSO)
- MDL-optimized adversarial ensembles
- Asymmetric graceful degradation

📄 Papers, analysis, and reference implementation are available in the Dao Heart repository.

## 📚 Research Interests

- AI alignment and corrigibility
- Multi-objective and value-based reasoning
- Governance of autonomous systems
- Formal safety invariants
- Philosophy of mind and identity in AI

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- Python, ML/AI systems, research prototyping
- Formal modeling and system architecture
- Technical writing and AI safety research
